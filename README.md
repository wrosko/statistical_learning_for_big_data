# statistical_learning_for_big_data
Project portfolio for Statistical Learning for Big Data containing the written report and respective scripts.

## Overview
This repository contains my analyses and exploratory methods for the Statistical Learning for Big Data spring 2018 class with Prof. Rebecka JÃ¶rnsten at Chalmers University of Technology/Gothenburg University.  

The exam was broken into three sections: 
  1. MINI review and assignments
  2. TCGA genomics data and mislabeled data
  3. Simulation studies of K clusters and L classes
  
The assignment questions are available in: ```Exam2018.pdf```

# MINI (Question 1)
The MINI assignments were weekly or bi-weekly and were aimed to help introduce various statistical/machine learning methods. I used various datasets, and also generated some of my own data. The R scripts are in this main directory, with associated data in the ```data/``` directory. 

```data/mini3/``` contains artificial data and the Python script used to generate it.

*MINI3 script is quite messy*

# TCGA (Question 2)
